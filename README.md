## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, my name is Yan Stephen Christian Immanuel Hutagalung. I am a 5th-semester student at Universitas Pertamina, majoring in Computer Science. Throughout my studies in computer science, I have learned several programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. Currently, my focus is on developing skills that can strengthen my position in the professional world. I am open to discussions, collaborations, or any projects. In the future, my goal is to work as a data analyst or backend programmer.
